    <h1>Personality and Impact on Academic Life</h1>

    <div class="traits-impact">
      <p>My strong tendency toward independence is one distinguishing feature of my personality. I'm naturally independent
      and have a propensity to take care of problems and obstacles on my own rather than actively seeking out social contacts.Although having a strong sense
      of independence might be useful in some circumstances, it has presented difficulties for me, notably in my academic career because I am now seeking a college degree.
      This tendency for self-sufficiency has had a somewhat negative effect on my college experience. Academic success requires a level of socializing and cooperation that
      is required of college students.

      <p>One of my favorite scenes/quotes is:</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Hero:</strong>
My hero is Cid, a fictional character who started as a mere background figure in his world. Yet, through unwavering determination and relentless
pursuit of knowledge, he transformed into the most formidable and intelligent presence in his universe. I deeply admire his journey from obscurity to greatness, achieved quietly and steadfastly.</p>

      <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> In my sincere assessment, the personality description aligns well with my characteristics, particularly in terms of narcissism, although I don't feel a strong inclination towards obsession, contrary to the 38% suggested. On the other hand, I strongly resonate with 
      the notion of being cautious and vigilant, exhibiting a heightened sense of paranoia towards both people and my surroundings.</p>
