      <h2>Career Goals and Qualifications</h2>
      <p>Originally, I aspired to become a pilot or a doctor, but life circumstances prevented me from pursuing those careers.

Additionally, I haven't given up on my dream of becoming a pilot or doctor; I intend to revisit these aspirations in the future.

My current academic journey spans four years of college, with one year already completed. I'm now tackling my second year, which presents its own set of challenges. Nevertheless, I'm fully committed to overcoming these obstacles by diligently working to excel in all my modules. My ultimate goal is to successfully complete my degree and open up new opportunities for myself.Im now aiming for the following qualifications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Master's Degree in Software Engineering or a Similar Field.</li>
        <li>Internships</li>
        <li>Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering.</li>
